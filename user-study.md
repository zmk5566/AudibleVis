## Experiment Procedure (with time Estimation)

### Training

##### Before the testing for any of the encoding method, a comsulsery 10 mins training will be provided as it is a common procedure in use such sonification system.

The training will contains three part :

### a. Zero training and the bound training (2min)

##### This is the help the user understand what is the Cartesian coordinates system in the user's mind. Three values are trained: Zero, Lower bound(-1), upper bound (+1)

### b. consistent value training training ( from the -1 to 1 )  8 mins



The user will be informed by the bound of the data from each encoding method. 16 sonified and linear interpolated sample (from -1 to 1) will be played, with voice-over instruction informing the user what the value it is.  The procedure will be proceed twice, with each time from (-1 to 1) and backward (1 to -1)

### c. Random value training (3-mins)

Random sonified value will be played. 16 samples will be presented


## Experiments

For each of the method, we will have 

For one-set data only

| Test Content      | Ref Test Number |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Value       | 1-1       |
| Trending   | 1-2        |
| Data Charastic   | 1-3        |
| ----------- | ----------- |


For two-set data only

| Test Content      | Ref Test Number |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Value       | 2-1       |
| Trending   | 2-2        |
| Data Charastic   | 2-3        |


## Post Experiment Questionaire 

The questionaire will ask about the cognitive feeling of the users according to the 3 systems, and future suggestions.
