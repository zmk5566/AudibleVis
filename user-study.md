##Experiment Procedure (with time Estimation)

1. Training

Before the testing for any of the encoding method, a comsulsery 10 mins training will be provided as it is a common procedure in use such sonification system.

The training will contains three part : 

a. Zero training and the bound training (2min)

This is the help the user understand what is the Cartesian coordinates system in the user's mind. Three values are trained: Zero, Lower bound(-1), upper bound (+1)

b. consistent value training training ( from the -1 to 1 )  8 mins

The user will be informed by the bound of the data from each encoding method. 16 sonified and linear interpolated sample (from -1 to 1) will be played, with voice-over instruction informing the user what the value it is.  

b. Random value training 

Random sonified value will be played.
